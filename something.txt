Once upon a time there was a javascript class at SI. 

It was a really good class!

They were learning about Git and Github!!


I am adding a line. 

Then the dogs said, "Meow!" and Allan ate a pizza.

The pizza had pineapples and so he spit it up.
Allan does not like pineapples.
Why?
we don't know.
