Once upon a time there was a javascript class at SI. AND MULTIPLE SQUIRRELS.  

It was a really good class! AND THE SQUIRRELS ENJOYED IT. 

They were learning about Git and Github!! BUT THE SQUIRRELS WERE CONFUSED


I am adding a line. SAID THE SQUIRREL

Then the dogs said, "Meow!" and Allan ate a pizza. SO THE SQUIRRELS LEFT. 

The pizza had pineapples and so he spit it up.
Allan does not like pineapples.
Why?
we don't know.
